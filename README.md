I am quite tall, I have curly hair. I tell everyone favourite animal is
the Capybara, but really it's a Fox 🦊.

I don't make anything important. Got a couple of things that others seem
to like though

-   [git-mit](https://github.com/PurpleBooth/git-mit/) - Helps you set
    co-authers on git commits, and will add in ticket numbers for you
-   [A Good README
    Template](https://github.com/PurpleBooth/a-good-readme-template) -
    Semi-tutorial, semi-template on how to make a good README
-   [A snippet pack for
    alfred](https://github.com/PurpleBooth/alfred-emoji-snippet-pack) -
    I wanted all the Emoji's in my alfred, so I made this
-   [dotfiles](https://github.com/PurpleBooth/dotfiles) - My dotfiles
    are also kicking about in here too

## Pretending I know things

I have spoken a bunch of places, Google is the best way to find those,
but here's some recent recordings I kinda like

-   [FizzBuzz using TDD (in
    Rust)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2dKBLGsYv4)
-   [Mutation Testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pi9JbG8gto)
-   [TCR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXC8e_Mkoow)

I also sometimes write things. Lately that's been on the Armakuni blog,
like this [VSM
article](https://cloudnative.ly/running-a-value-stream-mapping-session-5e1d43fba0).

## Short form screaming

If you want to read the terrible things I tweet and toot, you can follow
